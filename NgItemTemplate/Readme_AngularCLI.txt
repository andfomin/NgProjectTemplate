This Item Template adds an Angular CLI application to an existing ASP.NET Core project.

NOTE: To create an Angular CLI application as a stand-alone static website project, with no server-side code, use the Project Template that comes with this template in the same Visual Studio Extension.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you selected the "Add automatically" option in the template wizard, this item template would do the following:

* Run "ng new {projectName} --directory . --routing --skip-git --skip-install" in the project's root directory.

* Add a "baseHref" property to the object in "apps" in the .angular-cli.json file and assign either "/" in an Empty or WebAPI project or "/ng/" in an MVC or Razor Pages project to it.

* If an existing package.json is found, merge the package.json file generated by Angular CLI with it. 
The actual installation of the npm packages does not happen at the time of the application creation, it happens on next Build of the project.

* If an existing .gitignore file is found, append Angular CLI entries to it.

* Add NuGet package AfominDotCom.AspNetCore.AngularCLI to the project.

* Modify the existing Startup.cs file. 
  ** Add statement "using AfominDotCom.AspNetCore.AngularCLI;" at the beginning of the file.
  ** Insert the following code snippet in the Configure method at the end of the method in an WebAPI, MVC or Razor Pages project or before "app.Run(...)" in an Empty project:

if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
  app.UseNgProxy();
}
else
{
  // app.UseStaticFiles(); // Uncomment if this line is not present somewhere above in the Configure method.
  app.UseNgRoute();
}

  ** If no existing "app.UseStaticFiles()" call was found in the Configure method, insert a "app.UseStaticFiles();" line before "app.UseNgRoute();" in the code snippet as shown above;
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The path specified as "baseHref" in the .angular-cli.json file, is a relative path.
For example, if your main ASP.NET Core website runs at http://localhost:12345 and the "baseHref" value is "/ng/", the Angular app will be served at http://localhost:12345/ng
Requests to that relative path will be proxied to the standard NG Development Server launched from the ASP.NET Core code. 
Please note, the proxy is used during development only. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During a Publish, the template looks up a script name in package.json corresponding to the Build Configuration, and if found, executes it. 
For example, if the Build Configuration name is "Release", it will look for a script named "build:Release". 
If no corresponding script name is found, the default "build" script will be executed.
Then the template copies the files produced by the build script to a subfolder under the standard "wwwroot" directory, according to the relative path specified in the "baseHref" setting described above.
